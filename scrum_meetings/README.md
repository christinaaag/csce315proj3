# Scrum Meetings

Below is the date and the time for each scrum meeting. Our typical schedule would be Tuesday and Thursday from 1:30 PM - 2:45 PM CST. For the first sprint, we only had one week; due to the shortened timeframe, we held an addition meeting on Saturday from 1:00 PM - 1:15 PM CST. 

This folder will contain our recorded meetings; a Google drive link is also provided below for all meeting recordings. Each video title would be the Sprint#_Meeting#_Date.
